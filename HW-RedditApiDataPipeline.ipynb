There was this live tracker on NASA's website. I am not sure how accurate it is but it says LIVE so give or take precision. \\n\\nIt seems 3I-ATLAS have come across the sun and right now it is eclipsed by Venus from Earth's view point.  \\n\\nI am not a Astrophysicist/Astronomy professional for please help me understand this. We will be able to see 3I-ATLAS after it crosses the Venus and make itself visible which will be couple more days?\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ot4ayvs8v9yf1.png?width=817&format=png&auto=webp&s=48e657a90a92db9a5264599313086f8f02f9c3c4\\n\\n  \\nBut Mars seems to have a better view of 3I-ATLAS at the moment so do we have some equipment to photograph it right now? if yes, why aren't the space agencies doing it? \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Post Flair\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Mod Post\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Domain\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"purdue.edu\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Search Query\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": null,\n        \"min\": null,\n        \"max\": null,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 0,\n        \"samples\": [],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":121}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Create new dataframe called reddit_data_df with same column headings as above."],"metadata":{"id":"Wo1YfD9fa_0h"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["reddit_data_df = pd.DataFrame(columns = hot_Astronomy_df.columns)\n","\n","reddit_data_df.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":67},"id":"0pCwQDE9bJ6w","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1762140108221,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":24,"user":{"displayName":"Daniel B","userId":"01499084721254196845"}},"outputId":"61942082-431e-4c29-eeac-b7db8d4c7fb0"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["Empty DataFrame\n","Columns: [Title, Score, Upvote Ratio, Number of Comments, Author, Subreddit, URL, Permalink, Post ID, Created UTC, Selfpost?, Selftext, Post Flair, Domain, Search Query]\n","Index: []"],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-392b5e33-5dd8-42ff-8979-56f77485751c\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Title</th>\n","      <th>Score</th>\n","      <th>Upvote Ratio</th>\n","      <th>Number of Comments</th>\n","      <th>Author</th>\n","      <th>Subreddit</th>\n","      <th>URL</th>\n","      <th>Permalink</th>\n","      <th>Post ID</th>\n","      <th>Created UTC</th>\n","      <th>Selfpost?</th>\n","      <th>Selftext</th>\n","      <th>Post Flair</th>\n","      <th>Domain</th>\n","      <th>Search Query</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-buttons\">\n","\n","  <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-392b5e33-5dd8-42ff-8979-56f77485751c')\"\n","            title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","            style=\"display:none;\">\n","\n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\" viewBox=\"0 -960 960 960\">\n","    <path d=\"M120-120v-720h720v720H120Zm60-500h600v-160H180v160Zm220 220h160v-160H400v160Zm0 220h160v-160H400v160ZM180-400h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160ZM180-180h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160Z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","    </button>\n","\n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-buttons div {\n","      margin-bottom: 4px;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","    <script>\n","      const buttonEl =\n","        document.querySelector('#df-392b5e33-5dd8-42ff-8979-56f77485751c button.colab-df-convert');\n","      buttonEl.style.display =\n","        google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?

Most of you don't know me but I occasionally post rocket datasheets on this subreddit to give a better perspective of the current state of the launch industry. With the last rocket launch happening a few hours ago from China barring an unexpected launch, all rockets that would fly in 2021 have already flown. So what's left to do? Analyze the data of course!\\n\\nThis year was absolutely record-shattering in so many ways ranging from crewed launches to raw rockets launched, to raw kg launched to days spent in space by all humans. The major players leading to this rise is SpaceX and China in the raw rockets and kg launched, and Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin in the amount of crewed launches and. Lastly in the rise in total days spent in space by humans in space the Crew Dragon is largely responsible as it delivers 4 astronauts instead of 3 to the international space station. In addition, China's new space station (Tiangong) has played an immense role as 6 new astronauts were racking...\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Post Flair\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 35,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Cargo Dragon\",\n          \"News\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Domain\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 63,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"abc.net.au\",\n          \"skyheadlines.com\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Search Query\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"rocket\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":123}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Check length of our final dataframe.
