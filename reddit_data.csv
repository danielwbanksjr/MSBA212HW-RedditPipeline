Friendly mod warning here. In r/Astronomy, somewhere around 70% of posts get removed. Yeah. That's a lot. All because people haven't bothered reading the rules or bothering to understand what words mean. So here, we're going to dive into them a bit further.

The most commonly violated rules are as follows:

**Pictures**

Our rule regarding pictures has three parts. If your post has been removed for violating our rules regarding pictures, we recommend considering the following, in the following order:

1. *All pictures/videos must be original content.*

If you took the picture or did substantial processing of publicly available data, this counts. If not, it's going to be removed.

2) *You must have the acquisition/processing information.*

This needs to be somewhere easy for the mods to verify. This means it can either be in the post body or a top level comment. Responses to someone else's comment, in your link to your Instagram page, etc... do not count.

3) *Images must be* *...",Mod Post,self.Astronomy,

Like Charles Messier, Hodierna was a comet hunter who cataloged fuzzies in the night sky so they would not be mistaken for comets. With an apparent magnitude of 6, the Lagoon is faintly visible to the naked eye in dark skies, and easily seen with binoculars or small telescopes, with August being the best time to observe it.

This star-forming region is located about 5,200 light-years from Earth, and is home to its own star cluster, NGC 6530 . The massive stars embedded within the nebula give off enormous amounts of ultraviolet radiation, ionizing the gas in the H II region and making it glow.

1. **Unusually steep brightening law** As 3I/ATLAS approached perihelion, its brightness increased with a power law much steeper than the earlier observed trend at larger distances.
2. **Extended coma resolved near perihelion** Using data from GOES-19/CCOR-1, the comet was resolved as an extended source, with a coma of about **4 arcminutes in diameter**.
3. **Bluer than solar color → gas emission contribution** The color photometry from LASCO and CCOR-1 show that 3I/ATLAS is distinctly bluer than the Sun, which contrasts with its earlier redder dust-dominated appearance. This suggests that gas emissions (e.g. from C₂, possibly NH₂) contribute significantly to its visible light near perihelion.
4. **Possible explanation & uncertainty about rapid brightening** The authors discuss that the extremely high brightening rate might stem from an initially suppressed H₂O sublimation (perhaps because of CO₂ cooling) or unusual nucleus properties (composition, s...",Astro Research,arxiv.org,

This is also a very nice visual target in even modest telescopes, its visible in binoculars, and a 3"" telescope with about 50x will show dozens of stars within each cluster, an 8"" telescope will show 1-200 stars and with the right eyepiece can still  display both clusters in the same field of view.

Last week, I had the chance to travel out to Red Rock Canyon State Park in California to capture Comet Lemmon! It was barely visible to the naked eye, but a camera can reveal so much more—especially when stacking multiple exposures.  

Comet Lemmon reached perigee (its closest point to Earth) on the morning of October 21st. I only had about 40 minutes before it dipped below the horizon, so every shot counted.  

Capturing a comet is a whole different challenge compared to regular wide-field astrophotography. You need truly dark skies to pull out the faint tail—thankfully it was a moonless night. Even in a Bortle 2 zone, though, the light domes from Ridgecrest and Los Angeles crept into the frame, and the airglow made processing tricky.

Because comets move at a different rate than the stars, I had to align every image twice—once for the stars and once for the comet—then blend them together.

Alan retired from NASA in 1981 to devote his time to painting. He believed he had a special ability to paint space scenes, as he had seen the moon in a way most people never have

Alan used patches of his space suit he was given as keepsakes to add moon dust to every painting

This slope produces pressure and temperature differences at the ice–ocean boundary. These differences create density (buoyancy) gradients in the upper ocean.
* Here vertical mixing stirs heat between deep and shallow layers. This creates swirling flows(baroclinic eddies) caused by sloping density layers. The circulation loop creates which transports heat from polar regions toward the equator.
* Ocean flow is modeled using the Boussinesq approximation model. The differential rotation velocity of an ice shell or core depends on tidal, gravitational, and rotational forces.

My team and I are competing in a 24-hour hackathon this weekend under the “Invent” track, which is all about pushing boundaries of AI and tech and building something that’s never been done before.

Our idea: an AI mission-intelligence copilot that helps identify the safest, most efficient launch windows by analyzing space debris density, orbital paths, and weather conditions. It also simulates what happens if a launch is delayed (fuel, timing, communication windows, etc.) and generates a short, human-readable “mission summary” explaining the trade-offs.

We’re focusing on the pre-launch phase, so assuming all major mission parameters have already been carefully planned. Our system acts as a final verification layer before launch, checking that the chosen window is still optimal and flagging any new debris or weather-related risks. Think of it as a “sanity check” before the final go/no-go call rather than a full mission design tool.

This shows New Glenn upper stage in coast phase following booster separation. In this 4 minute time exposure, New Glenn is seen as the faint streak moving from lower right to upper left as it crosses the brighter vertically oriented star trails. This was not an easy photograph to take. ISS was over Oklahoma at the beginning and over central Gulf of Mexico at the end of the exposure. To photograph New Glenn, I set up three Nikon Z9 cameras with wide angle lens in the ISS Cupola, figuring one would catch its exo-atmospheric trajectory.

To the naked eye, the streak of light was a lot more of an orange color than the camera makes it out to be. It very very slowly moved up in the sky, the light grew in brightness, and then faded away after a short period of time.

After I got home I talked to my dad about it and we both did some Internet searches. SpaceX had launched a rocket but 1. The rocket launch date was from the night before (24th April 2025 at 21:52) and 2. the location of their launch was also in Cape Canaveral, which was behind me. In this picture I am facing west, and if I am to assume this is a rocket launch from land, then my guess would perhaps be that this rocket was launched from somewhere on the Florida panhandle.

Theoretically, it slowly replaces its thick CO2 atmosphere with oxygen and water vapor. As with any thought experiment, there are a number of assumptions that need to be made for this to work. The process is as follows:

1. A harvesting mechanism would orbit a Jovian planet and harvest the hydrogen the collects in the upper atmosphere. (This mechanism would need some way to offset the force of atmospheric friction. Perhaps a fusion rocket that can use said hydrogen as fuel?)

2. This hydrogen could then be mass-driven to Venus for processing.

3. The hydrogen arrives at Venus, and a fraction of it is used to power a [MOXIE](https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/faq/can-new-nasa-carbon-to-oxygen-conversion-technology-like-moxie-be-used-to-address-climate-change/) facility.

Time appears to slow down around you when you go at light speed.

My point is from your perspective when at speed of light earth slows down while from the perspective of earth you are going at the speed of light just the same while they are experiencing normal flow of time, whouldnt that mean that from the earth perspective the rocket going at the speed of light missed the earth because it moves past the rocket while from the perspective of the rocket earth slowed down so it doesn’t have time to move out of the way of collision.

1.

In general, does an electron need more energy to jump to another atom in very low temperatures?
   1. A. Bonus to question #1, is it correct that at 0 Kelvin it's impossible for an electron to jump from one energy level to another?
2. The spacecraft will be placed at Lagrange Point 2, how wide is this point where the gravity forces balance each other out? As I understand, the spacecraft's lifetime is based on the fuel it has to last 6-10 years to correct its orbit.

Today at **1:04 am EST**, NASA will conduct the first launch of the most powerful rocket in the world, the SLS, as part of the Artemis I mission. The goal of today's test flight is to send the uncrewed Orion capsule to the orbit of the Moon. The rocket is also carrying along several small satellites designed for lunar and asteroid science. In around a month's time, the Orion capsule will splash down in the Pacific Ocean and the mission will conclude.

This is the third launch attempt for Artemis I, after the first and second attempts a few weeks ago encountered problems with fueling the rocket and the engines. NASA has devised a plan involving slower fueling of the rocket so that hopefully, we get a successful launch today. *Third time's the charm!*

I've been exploring unconventional rocket launches lately, and while many seem limited to small payloads or face big challenges, I wonder if we could combine the best parts of two ideas: air-launch-to-orbit and SpinLaunch's kinetic system.

The idea is to reduce the fuel tank of a rocket. The remaining(engine and payload) is lighter and so could be carried by a plane. Meanwhile, a ground-based centrifuge (like SpinLaunch's) hurls shells of fuel into high atmosphere. The plane will catch it mid-flight, bound it with rocket engine, and launch into space.

It's like an aerial handoff: no first stage, just a lightweight rocket boosted by kinetically launched fuel.

The trade-offs? The catch needs to be fast and precise, and the whole system sounds complex—but not too crazy on par with *Skyhook*, maybe in the same level with *starship in-orbit refueling* challenge.

But the upside is huge: the rocket could have 100 tons total weight (80\~90 tons are spin launched), which is si...",Discussion,self.space,rocket

Im based in Malaysia and i recently learnt of the existence of space camp @ huntsville, Alabama.... looking through the facilities and programs online its seems very extensive and detailed... i suppose it benefitted from being so close to the redstone arsnal facilities and there is a huge NASA community nearby. However i cant help but notice the programs for the summer camps are very expensive per individual. Is this something only rich US kids partake? ... and im very interested in how well run the camp mangement is?.... cuz the equivalent in Malaysia is ""planetarium negara"" which is great when i was a kid and it was new and now its almost 30 years old the programs and exhibitions they offer pretty much stayed the same with very little refurbishments made throughout its history so far.

This rocket, called ""LongXing-2"", was launched days ago to carry out a 75KM height VTVL experiment.

The goals was to launch this into high attutide. Then make a controlled descending, and finally reach a zero-velocity right before splashing into the ocean.

The ascending phase and ignition of first stage descending boost was successful, but the second stage engines to reduce the velocity to 0 before splashing failed to ignited. The rocket smashed into ocean with much speed remain, ending this experiment as failure.

But this got me thinking about what it would be like to live on a planet so big that you could not escape it, and for a time some early scientists believed the same was true of our own.

Wouldn't there be ways to compensate?

Suppose you lived on one of these large planets and wanted to get to space, perhaps you can't create a single rocket that can do it, but does that really prevent you from building a mass-driver that can serve as a sort of 1st stage to get you that initial hundred-miles of thrust.

I imagine that obtaining early thrust must be extremely fuel-intensive, and that you might be able to gain another 2-4% if all rockets began their trips with this kind of vertical assist.

This would leave us with a fully fueled rocket high up, mitigate gravity and drag losses without a carrier aircraft. It seems like a simple enough concept, so where does the maths break down? Economics? Weight/lift?

I've been working on building a model rocket that can land like the Falcon 9 or New Shepard. This drop-test is to see how accurate the landing simulations are. After dropping from 50 meters, the rocket tried to ""land"" at 18m but came to a stop at 20m, just 2 meters away from the target altitude! I'm testing air-landings first, which are a bit safer in case things go wrong.

The guidance computer controls thrust vectoring, data logging, and most importantly it decides when to start the landing burn. The computer looks at velocity, altitude, and orientation to generate the optimal landing burn profile as it's falling. The retro-motor is solid propellant, and cannot be throttled, but with dynamic ignition timing you can still get surprising accuracy!

And yet for all the cool things this rocket can do, it couldn't get the parachutes out in time. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

You can turn on notifications, so you will be reminded before the liftoff. Also, there's a dark theme for night launches. It has Apple Watch support, which is currently only a countdown, but I plan to have notifications and more data displayed on it.

I was examining the December post the other day, and realized that the terms “Mass Ratio” and “Force Ratio” were most likely talking about the ratio between the BFR and the MCT. With a Mass Ratio of 3, that means the BFR will be three times as heavy as the MCT. And a Force Ratio of 5 means the MCT will have one-fifth the number of engines that the BFR will have. And, with the BFR having around 30 engines, we can conclude that 6 engines is probably the right number for the MCT.

Pros
- The rotation could be initiated by the grid fins
- Does not add weight
- The mass of the rocket rotating is helping the stability

Cons
- The software would be more complicated since the rotation would require the various stability jet thrusts and engine gimbal actions to keep changing as the rocket rotates
- The hardware (thruster jets, engine gimbals) might have to be more responsive to keep up with the changing direction requirement

I can imagine a couple of causes for the front of the rocket plume appearing to surge forward from time to time:

1. The condensation coming off of the body of the rocket is being lit (like, made bright) by the plume. It's not fire, just bright fog.

2. Turbulence around the back of the rocket occasionally pulls exhaust forward.

I guess an alternative version of the question goes like this: if I were riding a Falcon 9 right near the fiery end, would I have to worry only about radiated heat, or about actual fire as well? ",,self.spacex,rocket

The sentiment is that the typical usage and objective would be 100% reuse of a Falcon Heavy system. While re-usability is important, I think it's also logical to assume that there will be times when deliberately throwing away the center stage will just be practical.  

Obviously a stage can only be flown a certain number of times before its age begins to put the flight assurance at risk. Prior to reaching that point, the stage could be used as the center of the Falcon Heavy system and deliberately discarded. If it has reached the end of its useful life anyway, it might as well be used for the more difficult recovery missions.  

I imagine the same would be true of typical Falcon 9 or future MCT applications.

However, we can speculate what they might be working on now or in the near future, based on the companies future requirements.

Could you build a 1/10 scale that would make it to orbit with reduced payload?

Edit:

I want to emphasize (after a few standard scale porblem answers of ""no"") that I did specify that wall thicknesses and interioro flow channels would be kept to necessary sizes so this is not just a typical failing scale scenario.

It is more of a "" at what point do the wall thickness weights and flow channel sizes increase wright out of  proportion to the scaled down engine thrust so that the smaller rocket can't make orbit.""
